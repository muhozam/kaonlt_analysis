Here I send a slide with some useful derivatives of the invariant mass W. 

You should also try to derive them, starting with the formula for W. Apply
four momentum conservation at the nucleus vertex. Then, the square of the
four-momentum must be invariant in any reference frame. 

The derivatives assume that the other two variables are constant. So the variation in W with momentum assumes you know the beam energy and angles pretty well. 

Then you can compare W in SIMC to data, with the appropriate mis-pointing and beam offsets applied in SIMC. The question is how much does do you need to change the momentum by so that data agrees with SIMC. 

Since we do not yet apply energy loss / radiative corrections to the data, you should also NOT apply these corrections in SIMC (But you do want to simulate the energy loss/radiative tail).

Here is a summary of the files in this directory...

run_EvtNum_${spec}.sh is a bash file that reads in a string of run numbers from "inputRuns" then 
will run the scripts get_EvtNum_${spec}.C and plot_Stat_${spec}.C as well as produce an output 
file "outputGrep" which contains the run number and BCM4B charge.

get_EvtNum_${spec}.C will read in a root file to produce a fit around the peak of the  invariant 
value W^2. this outputs as a .png file and records the run number, spectrometer and integrates 
the W^2 peak to obtain the number of events in "numEvts_${spec}.txt".

plot_Stat_${spec}.C will read in a root file and output a .pdf which contains plots for the
xfp vs. yfp and xptar vs. yptar.

**Currently the read in root files are ones I have made, which are under my 
volatile/hallc/spring17/ROOTfiles/ directory. These root files are created by my run_Replay.sh
bash file in my hallc_replay_cdaq repo.

"inputRuns" are the string of run numbers described above.

The subdirectory OUTPUT is where the .pdf, .png, "outputGrep", and "numEvts_hms.txt" are located.
With the .png files having their own subdirectory

The subdirectory carlosFiles are scripts and plots provided to me by Carlos Yero, these are mostly 
for the Spring 2018 SIDIS runs. The exception is get_elastic.C which can calculate elastic values.
This is very useful.

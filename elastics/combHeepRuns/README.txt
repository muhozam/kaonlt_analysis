Here I send you the list of combined H(e,e'p) runs (HMS electrons), classified by kinematic groups, g1, g2, . . .
The W-peak is all over the place, which is why we are doing the study, so we can determine a correct mapping between the
dipole NMR and the momentum set. You can trust the angles and beam energy I used, since I got the angles from the camera itself, and the
beam energy from beam-energy measurements.

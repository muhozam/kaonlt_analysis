Here is a summary of the files in this directory...

plot_Yield.C reads in input file "yieldVar" which is just a copy of Yield_Data.dat in the hallc_replay_cdaq 
repo directory UTIL_KAONLT/scripts_Luminosity where these input files are calculated. With this input file 
plots of the relative yield for luminosity scans are created along with a clean table of various variables.

runInputs are a string of luminosity runs used for run_Replay_lumiscan.sh in the repo hallc_replay_cdaq
which is a bash file that will run the replays and create root files for analysis

The subdirectory OUTPUT is where the luminosity table "LuminosityScans.txt" is located along with the plots.

The subdirectory misc are old scripts, files and plots.
